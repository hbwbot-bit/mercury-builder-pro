export function formatServiceFAQ(): string {
  const now = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
  
  return `# Service & Maintenance FAQ
Updated: ${now}

## Winterization

### What is winterization?
Winterization prepares your outboard motor for storage during the cold Ontario winter months. It protects against freeze damage and ensures your motor is ready for spring.

### What's included in winterization?
- Flushing the cooling system with fresh water
- Running antifreeze through the system (fogging on older 2-strokes)
- Changing engine oil and filter
- Draining and treating fuel system
- Lubricating all grease points
- Battery removal and storage recommendations
- Thorough inspection for wear or damage
- Storage preparation report

### When should I winterize?
Book winterization in **October or early November** - before the first hard freeze. Popular slots fill up fast!

### Why does winterization matter?
- Prevents freeze damage to the powerhead (expensive repair!)
- Protects fuel system from ethanol damage during storage
- Extends motor life significantly
- Ensures reliable spring startup
- Maintains warranty compliance

### How much does winterization cost?
Pricing varies by motor size. Contact us for a quote. The cost is minor compared to freeze damage repairs!

## Maintenance Intervals

### Break-In Period (New Motors)
- Break-in RPM and hour phases are model-specific. Use the exact serial-number owner's manual.
- An optional dealer check is not the same thing as a scheduled oil service. Do not state a universal 20-hour oil change.

### Scheduled Service
- Build the scope from the exact manual, engine hours, elapsed time, serial number and condition.
- Do not promise one universal replacement list for every Mercury outboard.
- Many current manuals use 100-hour/yearly and 300-hour/3-year tables, but the applicable manual controls.

### Annual Service (Even if under 100 hours)
- Follow every time-based item in the exact manual even when engine hours are low.
- The annual scope may differ from the hour-based scope.

### Water Pump Replacement
- Many current Mercury manuals list the seawater-pump impeller at **300 hours or 3 years**.
- Confirm the exact engine schedule and inspect sooner when symptoms or operating conditions justify it.

### Gearcase Service
- Use the exact manual's interval and fill procedure.
- Milky lubricant or significant metal requires inspection; do not diagnose the failed component from appearance alone.

## Warranty Information

### Mercury Factory Warranty
- **3 years** standard on most FourStroke outboards
- Covers manufacturer defects in materials and workmanship
- Must be registered and serviced at authorized dealer

### Extended Warranty Options
- Available up to **8 years total** coverage
- Purchase within 12 months of motor delivery
- Covers parts and labor for covered repairs
- Transferable to new owner (adds resale value)

### Warranty Requirements
- Use only Mercury-approved parts and lubricants
- Follow recommended maintenance schedule
- Keep service records
- Have warranty work done at authorized dealer

### What's NOT Covered
- Normal wear and tear
- Damage from improper use or neglect
- Fuel-related issues from bad fuel
- Freeze damage (winterize your motor!)

## Professional Installation

### What's Included with Professional Installation?
When you purchase a motor with professional installation ("installed" option):

**Rigging Package:**
- Control cables (throttle/shift)
- Steering system
- Wiring harness and battery cables
- Fuel system and connections
- Gauge package or SmartCraft display

**Installation Labor:**
- Motor mounting and torque specs
- Control and steering installation
- All electrical connections
- Fuel system setup
- Full systems test

**Lake Test:**
- On-water performance verification
- Trim and height adjustment
- Prop selection and testing
- Customer orientation

### How long does installation take?
Typically 1-2 days depending on complexity and parts availability.

### Can I supply my own parts?
We recommend using our rigging packages for warranty and compatibility reasons. If you have specific requirements, let's discuss.

## Common Service Questions

### How often should I change the oil?
- Use the exact engine's maintenance table. Many current FourStroke manuals list **100 hours or yearly**, but the model/year/serial manual controls.
- There is no universal Mercury 20-hour oil-change rule.

### What oil should I use?
- Use the viscosity and formulation in the exact serial-number owner's manual.
- Mercury oil requirements vary by engine family and operating-temperature guidance.

### How do I know if my prop is right?
- At wide-open throttle, your RPM should be within the recommended range (usually 5000-6000 RPM)
- Too high RPM = need more pitch
- Too low RPM = need less pitch
- We can help with prop selection

### My motor is hard to start - what should I check?
1. Battery condition and connections
2. Fuel quality and age (old fuel is a common problem)
3. Fuel filter condition
4. Spark plug condition
5. If issues persist, bring it in for diagnosis

### How do I flush my motor after saltwater use?
1. Connect a flush muff or use the built-in flush port
2. Run fresh water through for 5-10 minutes
3. Let motor run at idle during flushing
4. Essential after every saltwater trip

### When should I replace my spark plugs?
- Use the exact engine schedule and specified plug.
- Many current Mercury schedules list replacement at **300 hours or 3 years**, with earlier inspection when a diagnosed issue requires it.

## Scheduling Service

### How do I book service?
- **Online:** ${HARRIS_PARTNERS.service_request.url}
- **Text:** 647-952-2153
- **Phone:** (905) 342-2153

### Emergency service available?
Yes! During the season, we offer priority service for breakdowns. Contact us immediately for on-water emergencies.

### Can you service my motor on the water?
Yes, we offer on-water service at our marina and for nearby waters.

  return `# Shaft Length & Transom Height Guide
Updated: ${now}

## Why This Matters - Customer Education Critical

**This is one of the most commonly misunderstood aspects of buying an outboard motor.** Many customers incorrectly believe they can simply buy a longer shaft "to be safe" or that it's "no big deal if the motor sits deeper." Both are wrong.

## What is Shaft Length?

${SHAFT_LENGTH_GUIDE.overview.what_it_is}

**Critical Point:** ${SHAFT_LENGTH_GUIDE.overview.why_critical}

**Common Misconception to Correct:** ${SHAFT_LENGTH_GUIDE.overview.common_misconception}

## Shaft Length Options

| Shaft | Code | Transom Height | Typical Boats |
|-------|------|----------------|---------------|
| Short | S | 13-16" | ${SHAFT_LENGTH_GUIDE.shaft_lengths.short.typical_boats} |
| Long | L | 17-21" | ${SHAFT_LENGTH_GUIDE.shaft_lengths.long.typical_boats} |
| Extra-Long | XL | 22-27" | ${SHAFT_LENGTH_GUIDE.shaft_lengths.extra_long.typical_boats} |
| XXL | XXL | 28+" | ${SHAFT_LENGTH_GUIDE.shaft_lengths.extra_extra_long.typical_boats} |

### When Customer Doesn't Know Their Transom Height
${SHAFT_LENGTH_GUIDE.sales_guidance.when_unsure}

### Key Message
${SHAFT_LENGTH_GUIDE.sales_guidance.key_message}

## Common Customer Objections & Responses

### "I don't mind if it sits a bit deeper"
**Response:** "I understand the thinking, but here's why that matters - when the motor sits too deep, the exhaust is underwater too far which creates backpressure. You'll notice sluggish steering, burn more fuel, and the motor works harder than it should. It's not just looks - it affects performance every time you go out."

### "Longer is safer, right?"
**Response:** "Actually, both too short AND too long cause problems. The motor is engineered to work at a specific height relative to the water. Too high and it cavitates; too low and you get backpressure and drag. The right answer is to match it properly."

### "My buddy has a longer shaft on his boat"
**Response:** "Different boats have different transom heights. What matters is YOUR boat's transom. Let's measure it properly so we get you the right shaft length. Saves headaches later."

## When in Doubt

- Have the customer measure their transom
- Invite them to bring the boat in
- Offer to look at photos
- Use the Transom Height Calculator on the website
- NEVER guess - getting this wrong is a real problem

- These are the ONLY promotions to quote. Never invent rebates, cash-back, financing offers, or bonus warranties that aren't listed below.
- All prices and discounts are in **Canadian Dollars (CAD)**.
- Bonus warranties **revert to the standard 3-year coverage** the day after \`Ends\`.
- If a customer asks about a promo not on this list, say "I'm not seeing that one on our current list — let me grab the latest from the team" and offer to text/email the active promo list at /promotions.
- For exact stacking, eligibility, and final pricing, always send them to the quote builder.
