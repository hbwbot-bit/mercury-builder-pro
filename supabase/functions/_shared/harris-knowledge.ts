  story: `Harris Boat Works has been serving Ontario boaters since 1947, when we first opened our doors on the shores of Rice Lake in Gores Landing. What started as a small boat repair shop has grown into one of Ontario's most trusted Mercury dealerships. We've been an authorized Mercury dealer since 1965 - that's 61 years of Mercury expertise. Three generations of the Harris family have dedicated their lives to helping boaters find the perfect motor and keeping them on the water. We're not just selling motors - we're building relationships that last generations.`
